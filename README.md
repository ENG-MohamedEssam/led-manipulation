# led-manipulation

## Abstract
#### I made this project at the begining of my journey in the Embedded Systems field
#### The project was about to manipulate a line of LEDs into making different shapes using only  port / pin to access the leds 
#### Different shapes were made such as (Snake effect - Ping Pong - diverging LEDs - Converging LEDs - Shift left - Shift right - Converge/Diverge )
#### And you could choose the mode you wanted using only 3 switches, and it depends on a truth table that i've created
#### The project was made using AVR (ATMEGA32)

### You can see the explanation of the project in the following video
